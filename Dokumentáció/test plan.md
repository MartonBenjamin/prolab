# Testing plan
Our team consists of three groups, <strong> frontend </strong>, <strong> backend </strong>, and <strong> database </strong>. The frontend with <strong> HTML </strong>, <strong> CSS </strong> and <strong> Java Script </strong> while the backend with <strong> RestAPI </strong>, <strong> React </strong> >, works with <strong> NodeJS </strong>. And the database is <strong> MySQL </strong>.

Frontend <strong> HomePage </strong>, <strong> RegisterPage </strong>, <strong> Contact </strong>, <strong> Order </strong>, <strong> LoginPage </strong>, and <strong> LoginForm </strong> On the backend, the major components are <strong> UserRegister </strong>, <strong> Login </strong>, <strong> MessageService </strong>.

Testing on the front end is performed by testers who walk through the pages, functions and check that both the appearance and the buttons and fields work properly. On the backend, an algorithm is used to load the database and the server, as well as the various functions / components with the help of testers. The program used to test the backend is primarily <strong> Postman </strong>. </br>
